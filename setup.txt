Render Deployment Setup (Static Site)
====================================

Overview
--------
This project looks like a static site (index.html + script.js). Render can host it as a Static Site with no build step.

Prerequisites
-------------
1) GitHub/GitLab/Bitbucket account with this repo pushed.
2) A Render account (https://render.com).

Steps
-----
1) Push the repository to your Git provider.
   - Ensure the root contains index.html and script.js.

2) Create a new Static Site on Render.
   - Log in to Render.
   - Click "New +" → "Static Site".
   - Select the Git provider and connect the repository.

3) Configure the Static Site.
   - Name: Autoflix (or any name you prefer)
   - Branch: main (or your default branch)
   - Build Command: (leave blank)
   - Publish Directory: .
     (This tells Render to serve files from the repo root.)

4) Deploy.
   - Click "Create Static Site".
   - Render will deploy and give you a URL.

5) Verify.
   - Open the Render URL and confirm the site loads correctly.

Optional: Custom Domain
-----------------------
1) Go to the Static Site settings in Render.
2) Add your custom domain and follow DNS instructions.

Notes
-----
- If you later add a build step (e.g., bundler), update Build Command and Publish Directory.
- For client-side routing (SPA), enable "Rewrite all to /index.html" in Render settings if needed.
